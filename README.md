# my-own-calculator(html, css, js)

I call this calculator Megalator3000 because i put some nice styles and more options into it.

I felt need to create this project for train CSS-Grid because i usualy work in Flexbox, also for improve my JavaScript skills. I know there is planty of tutorials on YouTube how to make JS Calc, but I dont want to copy someone, I want to make it 99% solo and figure out solutions, even if you think this code are messy and you have a lot easier techniques, im proud i did it myself without any help and ill improve my skills and code quanity :)

Welcome in my another project, this is very common and popular project, but programming is fun for me and i feel like i need to project and build my own calculator using basic frontend developer tools like html, css and javascript :)

Just like mine other projects, I don't like to copy someones work, I rather do something myself even if it's looking like noob-code, i would love to improve it later or back here in the future and look how much i improved myself as future programmer.
