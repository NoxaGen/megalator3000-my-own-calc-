# my-own-calculator(html, css, js)

PROJECT IS NOT COMPLETED, i think engine of calculator need solid rebuild.

I call this calculator Megalator3000 because i put some nice styles and more options into it.

I felt need to create this project for train CSS-Grid because i usualy work in Flexbox, also for improve my JavaScript skills. I know there is planty of tutorials on YouTube how to make JS Calc, but I dont want to copy someone, I want to make it 99% solo and figure out solutions, even if you think this code are messy and you have a lot easier techniques, im proud i did it myself without any help and ill improve my skills and code quanity :-)
