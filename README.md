# my-own-calculator--html--css--js-

Welcome in my another project, this is very common and popular project, but programming is fun for me and i feel like i need to project and build my own calculator using basic frontend developer tools like html, css and javascript :)

Just like mine other projects, I don't like to copy someones work, I rather do something myself even if it's looking like noob-code, i would love to improve it later or back here in the future and look how much i improved myself as future programmer.
